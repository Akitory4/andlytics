{"body":"Andlytics\r\n=========\r\n\r\nProject imported from last source code released by Timelappse (@andlytics) with fix by Maurizio Pinotti (@wwtwister).\r\n\r\nTrack your Android app's statistics.\r\n\r\nAndlytics tracks app statistics for ratings, daily downloads, total downloads and active installs. Android Developers can view app comments in all languages and AdMob statistics for revenue, request and impressions.\r\n\r\nThis is a Android developer tool for app tracking, only useful if you have published applications on the Android Market and access to the Android Market Developer Console.\r\n\r\nSupports auto sync of app stats with your android developer account. Statistics data can be exported to sdcard (pro only) and you can configure notifications for comments, ratings and downloads (also pro only). AdMob accounts will be managed by the Android account manager.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that Google doesn't provide a stable API to get download and rating stats. Therefore Andlytics might not work properly if something changes in the Android Market. In that case please be patient while we try to catch up with the changes.\r\n\r\nThis app is not related to Google in any way.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★\r\n- \"Google Apps for Business\" accounts are not supported yet\r\n- On some devices AdMob accounts keep disappearing, moving Andlytics from sdcard to internal storage might fix this\r\n- For AdMob accounts that are linked to a Google Account you can find the API password on the Account Information page http://www.admob.com/my_account/account_info.","tagline":"Android Market statistics app","note":"Don't delete this file!
