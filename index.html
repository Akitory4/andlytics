</ul><h1>Description</h1>

<p>Andlytics collects statistics from the Google Play Developer Console. It lets you track active installs, total installs, ratings, and comments for all your Android apps that are published on Google Play.</p>

<p>Andlytics can also collect AdMob statistics, including revenue, requests and impressions. It supports background syncing of stats and notifications for when changes occur.</p>

<p>Google does not provide a public API for collecting statistics. Therefore, if Google makes a change to the site it may cause Andlytics to stop working. In that case please be patient while we try to catch up.</p>

<p>Andlytics is open source, please feel free to contribute via GitHub.</p>

<p>Andlytics is not associated with Google in any way.</p>

<p>"Google Apps for Business" and Multi-connected developer accounts are not supported yet. If you have one of these accounts, contact us via GitHub and help us to add support.</p>

<p>On some devices AdMob accounts keep disappearing, moving Andlytics from sdcard to internal storage might fix this.</p>

<p>For AdMob accounts that are linked to a Google Account you can find the API password on the Account Information page <a href="http://www.admob.com/my_account/account_info">http://www.admob.com/my_account/account_info</a>.</p>

<p>Keywords: Developer console, developer tools, android developers</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Please fork this repository and contribute back using
<a href="https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/pulls">pull requests</a>.</p>

<p>The 'master' branch should always be in a stable, tested, and ready to go state so that we can implement quick fixes when Google breaks the 'API'. Therefore, all pull requests should be based on, and targeted to, the <a href="https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/tree/dev">'dev'</a> branch.</p>

<p>When submitting code, please try to be consistent with the code around you. As a general rule:
1. Use Tabs, not spaces
2. Aim for a maximum line length of 100, unless it looks better being on a single line</p>

<p>Any contributions, large or small, major features, bug fixes, unit/integration tests are welcomed and appreciated, but will be thoroughly reviewed and discussed.</p>
